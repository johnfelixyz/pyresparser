**Clients based solutions:**

**Deloitte:**

* Document Extraction with High quality
  * Dynamic model training with new type of data
* Training and self service

**Xerox:**

1. Delivery Ops & Remote solve \(ML and knowledge base\) anomaly prediction:
2. large amount of data ability, run time series data/continuous data streams

data analysis, pattern finding etc

2\) Doc. Digitization \(Low print low cost iOCR\) Handwritten docs â€“ Third-party \(azure,aws\): OMR comes critical.

**JPMC**:

**Anthem**:

* Platform as a ML run time platform
  * Self-service
  * Better debugging
  * Seamless propagation\(deployment\) into production
* Flexibility to add more libs in functional groups and model groups
* Run multiple model with same payload\(dataframe\) in Parallel \(AutoML\)

**Maersk**:

Low print low cost iOCR

Anthem: Doc. Digitization

JPMC: Part of doc.digitization\( mix of all of them\)

**Semx**: Stand. User experience â€“ evolved NLP

Knowledge base, understand existing info and link info from req.context back to know. Base :

Self-Service \(all needs\) â€“ channel partners â€“ robo UI, UST, Technosoft

Self-service, Seamless integration, Documentation

Unifying theme: **Decision intelligence** â€“ Report on decisions, provide feedback, way to measure decisions given by machines.

Models â€“ commodities: Domain understanding

Support them in use and train of those commodities to solve their problems

GIT iteration

NLP processing techniques

Loading time

Page limit in annotation tool

Auto save of the annotations to prevent session expiry

Feature attribution on Edge UI â€“ Ram and Arun

Making services as library - Indy

Runtime selection of services â€“ Indy arun Ram

Saturday:

Large file support in minio : Arun to talk with Vijay

LRU Cache????

Functional gaps in synthetic data generation :

Things that can be exposed as opensourcing to improve our platform visibility ðŸ˜Š

Separation of layers for sync and Async \|Notification Service : meeting with Ram, Mayank, Indy

**Time series model :**

**Custom scoring metric for model**: Mechanism for the user to write their own scoring logic as a Faas.

**Business Level ROI:** how do we demonstrate the value of the model. How does the model adds value to the user

**Visualization of model data:**

Improvise the import and export : bugs keep coming\

If the number of executions is very high, then the mongo logs are not getting proper

Mongo load improvement : Audit log, execution log, to be grouped
